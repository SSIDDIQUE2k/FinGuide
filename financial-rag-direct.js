Financial Literacy Compilation Content:

1. Emergency Funds: Emergency funds are essential for financial security. They should contain 3-6 months of essential expenses to handle unexpected situations like job loss, medical emergencies, or major home repairs. A well-funded emergency account provides financial security and prevents the need to rely on high-interest debt during crises.

2. Budgeting: The 50/30/20 rule is a simple budgeting framework: allocate 50% of after-tax income to needs (housing, utilities, groceries), 30% to wants (entertainment, dining out), and 20% to savings and debt repayment.

3. Investment Fundamentals: Diversification is key to managing investment risk. Spread your investments across different asset classes, sectors, and geographic regions to reduce overall portfolio volatility.

4. Debt Management: Prioritize high-interest debt first. Pay off credit cards and other high-interest loans before focusing on lower-interest debt like mortgages.
