Page 1: Introduction to Financial Literacy
Financial literacy is the ability to understand and use various financial skills, including personal financial management, budgeting, and investing. This foundational knowledge helps individuals make informed decisions about their money and build long-term wealth.

Page 2: Emergency Funds
Emergency funds are essential for financial security. They should contain 3-6 months of essential expenses to handle unexpected situations like job loss, medical emergencies, or major home repairs. A well-funded emergency account provides financial security and prevents the need to rely on high-interest debt during crises. Keep this money in a high-yield savings account for easy access while earning some interest.

Page 3: Budgeting Basics
The 50/30/20 rule is a simple budgeting framework: allocate 50% of after-tax income to needs (housing, utilities, groceries), 30% to wants (entertainment, dining out), and 20% to savings and debt repayment. This provides a balanced approach to spending while ensuring financial security. Track your spending for a few weeks to identify patterns and unnecessary expenses.

Page 4: Investment Fundamentals
Diversification is key to managing investment risk. Spread your investments across different asset classes, sectors, and geographic regions to reduce overall portfolio volatility. Start with low-cost index funds for broad market exposure. Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon when selecting investments.

Page 5: Debt Management
Prioritize high-interest debt first. Pay off credit cards and other high-interest loans before focusing on lower-interest debt like mortgages. Create a debt payoff plan and stick to it consistently. Avoid taking on new debt while paying off existing obligations.
